            <h2>The History of Mankind in the Far Future</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Millions of years of human history compressed into an epic saga of glory, betrayal, and endless warfare.</p>

            <div class="historical-era">
                <h3 class="era-title">⭐ The Dark Age of Technology (M15-M25)</h3>
                <p>Humanity reaches the peak of technological advancement. Humans colonize the galaxy through advanced space travel and artificial intelligence. Golden age of prosperity and progress. Then comes the catastrophe—the rise of artificial intelligences that destroy human civilization.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> The knowledge of the ancients is lost. Humanity enters the Age of Strife.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-era">
                <h3 class="era-title">⚡ Age of Strife (M25-M30)</h3>
                <p>Isolated human worlds fight for survival against alien predators, rogue AIs, and xenos horrors. Psykers begin to emerge in human populations. A mysterious figure known only as the Emperor begins uniting Terra.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Event:</strong> The Emperor brings Terra under his rule and begins preparations for galactic conquest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-era">
                <h3 class="era-title">🏛️ The Great Crusade (M30-M31)</h3>
                <p>The Emperor leads vast armies across the galaxy, bringing thousands of lost human worlds back into the fold. His sons—the Primarchs—are generals of his armies, each leading their own Space Marine Legions. It seems humanity's golden age is returning.</p>
                <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> 90% of known space unified under one rule. The Imperium is reborn.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-era">
                <h3 class="era-title">🔥 The Horus Heresy (M31)</h3>
                <p>The Emperor's greatest son, Horus, is corrupted by Chaos. Half of the Space Marine Legions turn traitor. A civil war tears the Imperium apart. The Emperor is mortally wounded but placed upon the Golden Throne, where he is sustained by psychic powers and human sacrifice.</p>
                <p><strong>Casualties:</strong> Billions dead. The Imperium is broken. Horus is killed by the Emperor in their final confrontation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-era">
                <h3 class="era-title">☠️ The Long War (M31-M42)</h3>
                <p>Eleven thousand years of slow decline. The Emperor cannot die but cannot speak. The Imperium becomes a theocratic institution bound by ancient dogma. Knowledge is lost. Worlds fall to Chaos, Necrons, and Xenos. The Dark Imperium on the far side of space suffers worst of all.</p>
                <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> The Imperium holds, but barely. Enemies gather on all sides.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-era highlight">
                <h3 class="era-title">⚔️ The 42nd Millennium (Present Day)</h3>
                <p>The current age. Cadia has fallen to Chaos. The Cicatrix Maledictorum—a Great Rift—tears through the galaxy. The Emperor's Primarch, Roboute Guilliman, has awakened after 10,000 years of sleep, bringing hope and confusion to the Imperium.</p>
                <p><strong>Crisis:</strong> The galaxy is in upheaval. The future has never been more uncertain.</p>
